* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
    - One of the new concepts that were a bit strange was the use of fetching and merging code with the use of git pull <origin/upstream> <branch>. In the past, I had exclusively used git rebase
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
    - In the past, I had normally added files to git using 'git .'. During the GPS Bison explained that using the '.' when adding files was a big no-no. Explaining that it is incredibly easy to add too many and/or the wrong files to a commit. Also, to my surprise it apparently will circumvent .gitignore sometimes. 
* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
    - One of the questions I asked was why DBC uses git pull/merge instead of Git rebase. 
    - At the beginning I asked how the Navigator/Driver roles worked for her and we figured out who should be who.
* What still confuses you about Git
    - One of my biggest confusions and curiousities how Git stores files changes and where it stores those changes. I am pretty sure that Git creates commmit hashes based off the files and there contents. They value is the contents? Aka, the commit hash is the key and the value is the actual content.
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
    - I really liked it, the ability to have a seasoned developer brought a relaxed anxiety to the mix. The ability to have questions and thoughts talked about with a more advanced perspective was great. Also, I really do like pairing with other students. The need to work with another person while trying to solve a problem is a lot of fun. It also brings a new kind of challenge to our course work. Then along with all of the having the guide in the same room is incredibly comforting.
