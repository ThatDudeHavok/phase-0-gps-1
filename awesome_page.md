**This partnership rocks!**

Today I worked with *Nick* on 1.1

He taught me how to use `git add .` Bison jumped in and told us the drawbacks of using this command instead of just doing `git add`. 

Nick sent me his [link] (https://github.com/mariauyeda/phase-0-tracks.git) to the GitHub where he cloned the repository to start off the exercise. This saved me a lot of time.
